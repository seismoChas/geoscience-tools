NOTES:

1) Need to have beautiful soup and pandas installed.

2) import Harvard_CMT_web_scraper

3) Use the primary get_events function to make the request. You must enter a date range, magnitude range, depth range, and region box, which are all lists.

4) The output is Harvard_CMT_startDate_endDate.txt where startDate and endDate are the dates you put in the date range list.

5) Output format: timestamp,longitude,latitude,depth,Mw,M0,faultPlane1,faultPlane2

6) The faultPlane1 and faultPlane2 columns are lists of the fault plane solutions (strike,dip,rake). They will be read by pandas as strings. To evaulate then as literal, use: from ast import literal_eval
